# DiyOS - do it yourself [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leonardoms/DiyOS.svg?branch=2019)](https://travis-ci.org/leonardoms/DiyOS)
Small study Operating System

This is a very very very experimental code, no warranties, it's for own study. :rage3:

If want to compile you need a [Cross-Compiler GCC](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).
